# HumanCallStack

This is an interation on my previous project, [stackToDo](https://git.clortox.com/tyler/stackToDo).

## Install

By default, the install script will install everything into `~/.local/bin`. Be sure to have this in your `$PATH`!

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Usage

```
stack - Watch in real time the state of the call stack
tpeek - Look at the top (most recent) task in the stack
tpop  - Pop off the latest task from the stack
tpush - Push a new task onto the stack
```

## Development

Be sure to to development with `pre-commit` installed. I use `pre-commit` to enforce code quality standards upon myself.

Find the active development version on my [gitea](https://git.clortox.com/tyler/HumanCallStack).
